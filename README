    Spreadsheet Writer for PHP

DESCRIPTION

    Low memory, high performance library for writing large spreadsheets in various standard formats. 
    Only a small subset of features are included, which means row level styling and right now, no 
    formulas either.

    Memory: Everything is written to disk, so memory overhead is pretty much zero.
    Speed:  It's pretty damn fast! However because of the memory constraint, it's not mindblowing.

    Note: This is still only ALPHA/BETA quality.

REQUIREMENTS

    * PHP 5.3
    * ZipArchive (only OOXML and you can create your own zip compressor, if you prefer another solution)

WRITERS

    * Office Open XML Spreadsheet (.xlsx)
    * Microsoft Excel 2003 XML (.xml)
    * CSV (.csv)

EXAMPLE

    Create a configured Book and close after you done.

        $fp = fopen('example.xlsx', 'w');
        $config = new Configuration();
        $config->setWriter(Configuration::WRITER, 'OfficeOpenXml2007StreamWriter');
        $factory = new OMFactory($config);
        $book = $factory->getConfiguredBook();

        // Add rows and styles

        $book->close();
        fclose($fp);

    Add 100.000 rows with 25 columns in ~25 seconds.

        $sheet = $book->newSheet();
        for($i = 0; $i < 100000; $i++) {
            $sheet->addRow($this->factory->getRow(range(0, 25)));
        }

    Add styling to a Row.

        $style = $book->newStyle()
                      ->setFontBold(true)
                      ->setFontFamily('Aria')
                      ->setFontSize('14');
        $row = $factory->getRow(array('cell1', 'cell2'));
        $row->addStyle($style);

    Custom Compressor for OOXML

        class CommandLineCompressor implements Seine\Compressor 
        {
            public function compressDir($source, $destination)
            {
                exec('zip' . escapeshellarg($source) . escapeshellarg($destination)); // Most likely does not work :)
            }
        }

        $compressor = new CommandLineCompressor;
        $writer = new Seine\Writer\OfficeOpenXML2007StreamWriter($fp, $compressor);
